# OpenSigBase
This repo aims to be the biggest database and library of signatures, from celebrities' signatures to army commanders' and signatures of historical figures, these signatures are stored alongside key identifying components for these signatures and additional signatures are stored for those who took several positions in their lifetime and therefore their signatures differ between periods.
